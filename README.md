# apXterm

Licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2). See the COPYING file for details.

I wanted to try mimicking the mobaXterm app that is only available for windows, so Linux users could use its features too.

```sh
# build
$ make

# clear the previous build
$ make clean

# run
$ make run
```

## incoming features

- Implementing PTY communication with a shell (e.g., Bash) to allow real shell interaction.
